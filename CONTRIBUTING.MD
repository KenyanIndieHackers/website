# Contributing to Kenyan Indie Hacker Startup Showcase

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to the Kenyan Indie Hacker Startup Showcase! This document outlines our contribution process and guidelines.

## Branch Management

The primary branch that will be built and deployed is the `main` branch. This branch should always build, lint, and pass all tests successfully.

Code can only be merged to the `main` branch using a Pull Request (PR), once the PR has been reviewed and any necessary changes have been made.

## Creating Branches

### New Features

When working on a new feature, create a branch with a `feature` prefix. Always include the task number and an abbreviated version of its title.

Example: If the task is titled "1 Add startup submission form", the branch would be:

```
feature/1_Add_startup_submission_form
```

### Bug Fixes

When working on a bug fix, create a branch with a `fix` prefix. Include the task number and an abbreviated version of its title.

Example: If the bug fix is titled "4 Fix startup card layout on mobile", the branch would be:

```
fix/4_Fix_startup_card_layout_mobile
```
